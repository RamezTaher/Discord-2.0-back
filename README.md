# Discord Clone API

This is the backend for the [Discord Clone React](https://github.com/RamezTaher/Discord-2.0-Front) project.

## Setting up the Backend

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Create a `.env.development` file in the root directory and paste the following:

   ```
   PORT=
   COOKIE_SECRET=
   ENVIRONMENT=

   MYSQL_HOST=
   MYSQL_PORT=
   MYSQL_USER=
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=
   MYSQL_BD=

   ```

```

4. Run `yarn start:dev` or `npm run start:dev` depending on which package manager you use to start the project in development mode.
```
